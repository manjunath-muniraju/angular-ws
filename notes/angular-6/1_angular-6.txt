1.2 Component Based Model
Understand the component-based mental model that's helpful when thinking about Angular application development.

Example:

if we need to display time on web page
we write html and embed JS to display the time. This is how we broke it down to achieve the display of time.
But in Angualar we will not have implicit divide like html or JS separate instead it will take Component based approach.

Like., Header component, side bar component, footer and body


<header-section></<header-section>
<main-section></<main-section>
<side-bar></<side-bar>
<footer-section></<footer-section>\

each section can have sub-components. like main section can have summary and details sub-component.
Now in Angular application there will be Root Component.

1.3 Setting Up
Let's setup the development environment to run Angular applications. This includes NodeJS, the editor (Visual Studio Code) and the Angular CLI.

Angular CLI - Command-Line-Interface:

There are bunch things need to be done to kick start Angular application
We need more than one file to be organized to start Angular app. So need all the bolier code.

Angular CLI is a utility to generate required files to start Angular application. Like bare bones project.
To install Angular CLI, use npm cmd

npm install @angular/cli -g

note: This is called a 'scoped' package name. These names are of the format @group/package.

to see Angular version installed,
ng version


1.4 Creating and running a project
Learn how to use the Angular CLI's `ng new` command to create a new Angular project. Then use the `ng serve` command to run the project and access it in a browser.


np new first-project

cd first-project
configure the new project into editor

in cmd -> ng serve

ng serve - it create http server and host the project you have, then you can access that localhost url and loads the page. then we can make changes in the page.

url i will be displayed in the console
http://localhost:4200/


1.5 Introducing the app component
Let's examine the root component of teh generated Angular CLI project - the `app` component.

1.6 Creating your first component
Create a component from scratch using the Angular CLI's `generate` command. Understand what that command does and examine the resulting files.
